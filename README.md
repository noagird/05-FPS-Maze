# FPS Maze Escape
A quick FPS maze game made by me (11/22/2022)

Description
A game wherer the objective is to get the key and escape at the exit while dodging monsters.

## Implementation
Included player/monster health, a usable gun, and nice sound ambience to help guide the player to the key

## Future Development
I meant to add more sound effects but did not have the time to code them properly. I also meant to replace the models of the enemy and the gun with something a biut more appealing.
